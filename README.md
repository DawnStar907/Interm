# Interm

I was just trying to see how cursed of a source file I could make for this project, and I managed to get it down to 21 lines for the whole thing. I could go further of course, but I like how it looks currently.
## Running

To use, copy and paste the following script into your terminal.




```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DawnStar907/Interm.git
  cd Interm

```
## Dependencies
Running Interm requires ncurses, and gcc.  
Acquiring these may differ OS by OS. I can list what I do know best however.
### Arch
```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc ncurses
```
