# Interm

I was bored and wanted to make something really cursed yet functional. Its a really comfy filebrowser in your Terminal. Would love to hear feedback or criticism

(I thought it was funny to make it as small as possible, there is a second human readable version)
## Running

To use, copy and paste the following script into your terminal.




```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DawnStar907/Interm.git
  cd Interm

```
## Dependencies
Running Interm requires ncurses, and gcc.  
Acquiring these may differ OS by OS. I can list what I do know best however.
### Arch
```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc ncurses
```
